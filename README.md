ComS 311 Project 2
For this project, I had to implement shortest path algorithms in both ImageProcessor and WGraph. ImageProcessor to the RGB data in the form of arrays of data. I uploaded the values into stacked arraylists they calculated what the shortest path from Height = 0 to Height = n was taking only 1 node from each row.
WGraph took a input file that had node locations and connections along with costs. The program then had to find the shortest path for either node-to-node, set of nodes - to - node, or set of nodes - to - set of nodes.
